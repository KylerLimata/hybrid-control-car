    "# Hybrid Control Car\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will demonstrated a hybrid machine learning and optimal control theory approach to controlling a simulated racecar. A neural network - which will henceforce be referred to as the pathfinding network - will be trained using reinforcement learning to pathfind, selecting the position of and the desired velocity of the car at the next path node based on sensor readings and the current state of the car. An inner control loop will use model predictive control with LQR feedback to drive the car to the next node.\n",

    "# 1 Deriving a Model of the Car\n",
    "\n",
    "While an accurate model of the car itself could be derived mathematically, for the purposes of this project we will not attempt to do so, treating the car as a standing for a far more complex system. To that end, we will use Sparse Indentification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to create a model of the system computationally using the pySINDy library. This algorithm was chosen for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It may be difficult to linearize about an equilibrium point while still maintaining a high level of accuracy.\n",
    "2. pySINDy allows for finding the nonlinear dynamics using multiple trajectories of test data.\n",
    "3. []\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with at least 75% accuracy for the first few seconds is desired. Later on, feedback control will be used to compensate for any inaccuracies in the model, so a near-perfect model is not necessary, but we will aim to create one anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Simulation and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the state and input vectors requires balancing adequet representation of the system and control in the inner MPC controller loop with the complexity of the model. A model with more states specifically will require the pathfinding network to determine more states for the next node and will make it more difficult to fit the SINDy model with accuracy. With these considerations, the following state and input vectors have been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ z \\\\ v \\\\ n_x \\\\ n_z \\end{bmatrix}, \\vec{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta \\\\ F_e \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ and $z$ are the position of the car along those axis, $v$ is the forward velocity scalar of the car, $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the unit vector components in the forward direction of the car in the $xz$ plane, $\\theta$ is the steering angle of the car, and $F_e$ is the force exerted by the engine. While the angular velocity about the y-axis could be considered, it seems like it would add more complexity to the model for very little gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of units, we will define one second as equivalent to 60 simulation timesteps. Since $x$ and $z$ are returned in units and $v$ is returned in units per timestep, we will define one meter as equivalent to 60 units, otherwise we will get very large velocities and distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data will be generated by holding both inputs steady at multiple different values, holding one steady while one is changes, and by having both change; Testing data will be generated in the same way."
